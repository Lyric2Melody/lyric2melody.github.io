      <description>Task Description Lyric-to-melody generation is one of the most important automatic music composition tasks. With the rapid development of deep learning, previous works address this task with end-to-end neural network models. However, deep learning models cannot well capture the strict but subtle relationships between lyrics and melodies, which affects the harmony between lyrics and generated melodies. In this paper, we propose ReLyMe (Relationships between Lyrics and Melodies), a method that leverages lyric-melody relationships from music theory to alleviate the dissonance between lyrics and melodies.</description>
